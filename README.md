# BouncingBalls
 
This was the first exercize in which I should define at least two simple rules which my sketch should follow.

I wanted to create a canvas in which balls are bouncing around and are impacted by gravity.
Rules: 
- Clicking on a ball destroys it
- New balls can be created with the press of a button. 
- All balls can change their colors (with fading) on pressing a key
- Program should be pause-able
